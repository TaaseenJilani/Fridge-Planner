# **A FRIDGE PLANNER**

## *The solution to wasted food*

The application is a fridge planner that will help the user keep track of all food items in their fridge. The user will 
be able to check if there is already a certain item in the fridge before cooking something new, which will make it much 
easier to not waste any food that might be expired. Almost anybody can use this application, since almost everyone owns
a refrigerator nowadays and are constantly using it to keep food there. This project is of interest to me because in my
household, we often end up finding things in the fridge that have been there for ages and that have expired now because
we did not know it was there in the first place. For instance, my mother would cook new chicken curry not realizing that
there is already chicken curry in the fridge, and that ends up being a huge waste of food. That is why, I wanted to 
develop some way to solve that problem.
